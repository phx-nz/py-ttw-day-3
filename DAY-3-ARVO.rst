Day 3 Arvo: SQLAlchemy & Alembic
================================
This afternoon we're going to enhance the application further, by introducing a proper
PostgreSQL database, using `SQLAlchemy <https://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_ as our ORM and
`Alembic <https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/>`_ for managing schema migrations.

Setup
-----
To get things working, you'll need to do a few things:

#. Stop the application server if it is currently running::

      pipenv run docker-stop

#. Install a few more dependency packages::

      pipenv install --dev

#. Rebuild the application and start the servers::

      pipenv run docker-start

   Note that this time Docker starts two containers ‚Äî an application server and a
   database server.

#. Run the first database migration::

      pipenv run alembic upgrade head

#. Lastly, seed your new database with some new profiles::

      pipenv run app-cli generate profiles

And you should be good to go!  Try sending a request to
`http://localhost:8000 <http://localhost:8000>`_ to make sure the application server is
running.

.. tip::

   Just like how you can connect to the application server using your browser or API
   development tool, you can also connect to the database server using a DB browser
   (such as the databases tool window in your IDE).

   Look at `.env.development <./.env.development>`_ to see the connection details.

   Note that normally we would not commit ``.env.*`` files to the repository, but in
   this case we're making an exception so that we can dive into the workshop exercise
   more quickly üòÅ

Resetting the database
----------------------
The database server stores its data files in a
`Docker volume <https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/>`_, so that the data are
persisted even when the container isn't running.

If you want to reset the database and start over, do the following:

#. Stop the servers::

      pipenv run docker-stop

#. Reset the database::

      pipenv run docker-reset-db

#. Start the servers again::

      pipenv run docker-start

#. Re-run schema migrations::

      pipenv run alembic upgrade head

#. If desired, re-seed the database with some profiles::

      pipenv run app-cli generate profiles

Exercise instructions
=====================
The goal of this afternoon's exercise is to refactor your code to make it work with
SQLAlchemy.

.. tip::

   If you get stuck at any point, you can check the ``solution`` branch, which contains
   a completed solution for this exercise.

Step 1: Get profile by ID (HTTP interface)
------------------------------------------
We'll start with the API endpoint to get details about a profile.

Integration test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You probably don't need to make any changes to your integration test.  Testing
interfaces over implementation details FTW üòé

API endpoint
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* The app uses
  `SQLAlchemy's asyncio extension <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/orm/extensions/asyncio.html>`_
  to access the database, so you'll need to make your API endpoint function ``async``.

* Access the profile service using the new ``services.get_service()`` function, like
  this:

  .. code-block:: py

     from services import get_service
     from services.profile import ProfileService

     @router.get("/profile/{profile_id}")
     async def get_profile(profile_id: int) -> dict:
         profile_service: ProfileService = get_service(ProfileService)

  .. note::

     The redundant type hint is unfortunately necessary to make code completion work in
     JetBrains IDEs, for now (it should be fixed in the next release).  See
     `https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-60767/ <https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-60767/>`_
     for more information.

* Create a database session using ``profile_service.session()``, like this:

  .. code-block:: py

     async with profile_service.session() as session:

* Modify the code to get the profile so that it fetches the profile from the database
  instead of the JSON file.  You can use ``session.get()`` or ``session.scalar()`` for
  this.

.. tip::

   The end result should look something like this:

   .. code-block:: py

      # src/api/routers/v1.py
      from services import get_service
      from services.profile import ProfileService

      @router.get("/profile/{profile_id}")
      async def get_profile(profile_id: int) -> dict:
          async with profile_service.session() as session:
          profile: Profile | None = await profile_service.get_by_id(session, profile_id)

          if not profile:
              raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Profile not found")

          return model_encoder(profile)

      # src/services/profile.py
      class ProfileService(BaseOrmService):
          @staticmethod
          async def get_by_id(session: AsyncSession, id: int) -> Profile | None:
              return await session.get(Profile, id)

              # Or:
              return await session.scalar(
                  select(Profile).where(Profile.id == id).first()
              )


Step 2: Get profile by ID (CLI interface)
-----------------------------------------

Step 3: Update profile by ID (HTTP interface)
---------------------------------------------

Step 4: Update profile by ID (CLI interface)
--------------------------------------------

Step 5: Stretch goals
---------------------
This step is optional.  If you're feeling confident and want to tackle some extra
challenges, give these a try üò∫
